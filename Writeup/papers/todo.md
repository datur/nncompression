# TODO

## What do i want to target

- GPU or FPGA or Intel Neural Compute Stick, Nvidia

### Read a shed load of papers

Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 with raspberry pi

What will i be doing? has it been done before

to do

send pdf of structure for d1 report before tuesday meeting
under each headding a bulleted list of what will be in each section
follow piece of paper

What i want to do:

Use Resnet variant network, either pretrained or trained from scratch
Evaluate pruning and quantization methods on either imagenet, cifar 100 or cifar 10
Evaluation hardware is comparing neural compute stick and gpu? 
Could latency be evaluated using a VPS with GPU for inference and comparing to NCS2

AWS Cost per hour either $3 - $24 for on demand per hour or $1-$7 per hour for spot pricing

Questions for rob:

What referencing Style would you prefer?
Are we allowed any aws credits? or do we have access to gpu server?
