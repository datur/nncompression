\section{Research Questions}
How does model size impact time to inference?
Does combining Pruning and Quantization help Model size and inference?
How does offloading completely to cloud for inference compare to device inference?
How can the DNN inference pipeline be transformed into a stream processing pipeline

Who are stakeholders

what are their needs

- Requirements analysis

Prioritise Needs

Distinguish functional and non functional requirements

Must, Should Could and Wont for requirements

Use Case studies
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
for example the network should be built using cnn architecture
\subsection{Non Functional Requirements}
for example which framework will be used
